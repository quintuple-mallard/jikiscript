## Usage

### Setting up the interpreter

Copy the entire src folder into an appropriate place, then change the shebang at the top of `jikiscript.js` to the location of your nodejs installation.

Next, run this command:
`ln -s /path/to/your/jikiscript.js /usr/local/bin/jiki`

Finally, add `/usr/local/bin/jiki` to your path.
You should now be able to run `jiki` as a command.
